## What is React JS
React is an open source web framework used for developing UI components and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. 

## Why React?
A common question that users may ask themselves before learning React. Well React is easy, simple and really powerful when it comes to developing web frameworks. We can see React taking over the entire Web Development in the long run. React is used to by more than 8000+ companies in their tech stacks including: 

* Airbnb
* Netflix
* Facebook
* Instagram
* Uber
* Amazon
* Twitter
* [and more](https://stackshare.io/react)

Another best reason to learn React is, that it is simply the **best**.

## Getting Started
Okay so, before getting started with React, the basic pre-requisite is to learn *HTML, CSS and JavaScript* because these are basic web development frameworks you'll need right before you dig into React. These don't take much time and are really super easy to learn and implement. 
Assuming that you already know the above basic Web Development Frameworks, let's begin!

#### Installation
Before you start working and developing web apps with React, you are going to need some tools and IDE's on your computer to work with.

* Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). The website will automatically detect your OS and provide you installer and steps for the same. Once NodeJS has been installed, go ahead and fire up your Terminal/Command Prompt and type ``` node --version ```. It will successfully show the version of Node installed. If you get any other error command, reboot your system and if the error still persists, reinstall Node. My current Node version is ```v12.19.0``` which is the latest one, as of October 2020.
